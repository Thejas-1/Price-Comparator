"""
Objective: add an INDENT token and a DEDENT token arround every block.

Strategy: put after every ":" that is not in a slice/dictionary declaration/lambda.

Slice and dictionary are easy: increase a number when a "[" or "{" is found,
decrease it for a "]" or "}". If the number is != 0, we are in a dictionary or
slice -> do not put a INDENT when a ":" is found.

Lambda are a bit different: increase another number when a "lambda" is found,
if the number is != 0 and a ":" is found, decrease this number, otherwise put a
INDENT.

For the DEDENT, I'm probably going to need to keep a list of indentation and
decheck the last one every time I encounter a meaningfull line. Still need to
test this idea.
